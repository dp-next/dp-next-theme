Random text: The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could
remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date
they had first appeared. It had seemed they'd always been there and yet
they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a question
that had been asked time and again, but while they all thought it,
nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So, the shoes
remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal
in another.

Here's a table:

| Name | Age |
|------|-----|
| John | 23  |
| Jane | 24  |

A list:

1.  first
2.  second
3.  third
