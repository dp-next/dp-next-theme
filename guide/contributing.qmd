This theme is a [Quarto brand
extension](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/brand.html) that provides
a set of defaults and customisations on top of the base
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) theme. It is used across DP-Next
websites, so when making changes, be careful to avoid breaking things
downstream.

Before adding custom CSS or JavaScript, check whether your change can be
achieved through the theme files or existing
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) or
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) options — custom code can
introduce accessibility issues and is harder to maintain.

## Before you start

We recommend opening an
[issue](https://github.com/dp-next/dp-next-theme/issues/new) to discuss
proposed changes before working on them, especially for larger or more
complex additions.
:::

## Theme structure {#sec-theme-structure}

The theme lives entirely inside `_extensions/dp-next-theme/`. The two
most important files are `_brand.yml` and `_extension.yml`.

### `_brand.yml`

Controls the visual identity of the theme: fonts, colours, and custom
CSS rules. Edit this file to change the theme's appearance. We use fonts
from [Bunny](https://fonts.bunny.net/), a privacy-friendly alternative
to Google Fonts. See Quarto's [Brand
Elements](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/brand.html#brand-elements)
page for available options.

### `_extension.yml`

Defines the theme metadata and site-wide defaults. The `contributes`
section is where you can set defaults for all sites using the theme like
the navbar logo, favicon, or footer text.

### Adding logos

Logos live in `_extensions/dp-next-theme/logos/`. Add new logos there,
then reference them in `_extension.yml` (for navbar or favicon) or
directly in `.qmd` files in repositories using the theme.

## Contributing changes

When contributing, make a [pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
with your changes. For an introduction to the pull request and commit
conventions we follow, see these chapters in the [Seedcase
guidebook](https://guidebook.seedcase-project.org/):

- [Pull
    requests](https://guidebook.seedcase-project.org/workflows/prs)
- [Commits](https://guidebook.seedcase-project.org/workflows/commits)

### Development setup

If you want to test changes locally before pushing, you can clone the
[dp-next-theme](https://github.com/dp-next/dp-next-theme) repository and
run the site locally. To do that, you need to install
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [`just`](https://just.systems/), and
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). Then run:

``` bash
just install-precommit
```

Run `just` to see all available commands. The most common one is
`just run-all` that runs all checks and tests, including building the
site locally to check for errors.
