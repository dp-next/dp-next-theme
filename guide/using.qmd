title: Using the DP-Next theme
---

This guide walks you through adding the DP-Next theme to a repository
that uses Quarto.

The DP-Next theme is a
[Quarto brand extension](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/brand.html),
which you can install and use in your project. The extension provides
the theme's styling (brand) as well as default website settings, such as
the navbar, search bar, and page footer.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
installed, version **1.8.0 or later**. Check your version by running
`quarto --version` in a terminal.

To add the DP-Next theme to your project, you need to have a git
repository set up locally on your computer. So either:

1. Create a Git repository locally or on GitHub, and clone it to
   your computer.
2. Use an existing repository and clone it to your computer. If you have
   the repository locally already, make sure to pull the latest changes
   before continuing.

## Add the theme to your project

To add the DP-Next theme to your project, run the following command in
the terminal, from the root of your project:

```bash
quarto add dp-next/dp-next-theme
```

This command adds the DP-Next theme to your project in the
`_extensions/` folder. In the `_extensions/dp-next-theme/` folder, you
can find the theme files as well as images such as logos.

Then, add to your `_quarto.yml` file that the project is of type
`dp-next-theme`:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: dp-next-theme
```

This will apply the DP-Next theme to your project, including the
default website settings.

::: callout-note
If you only need the visual styling for a **single standalone document**
(not a full website), omit the `project` key shown above and set
the `format` instead:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format: dp-next-theme-html
```
:::

## Update the theme

To update the `dp-next-theme`, run:

``` bash
quarto update dp-next/dp-next-theme
```

This replaces the files in `_extensions/dp-next-theme/` with the newest
version from the `dp-next-theme` repository. Commit the updated
extension files to GitHub to apply the update to your project.
