Releases in the context of websites are simply snapshots in time of the website content. We use Commitizen to automatically create these releases using SemVer as the version numbering scheme.\nBecause releases are created based on commit messages, a new release is created quite often—sometimes several times in a day. This also means that any individual release will not have many changes within it. Below is a list of the releases we’ve made so far, along with what was changed within each release.\n\n\n\n\n\n🚚 rename logos, e.g., au-logo.png to au.png (#18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💄 white navbar with quarto grey bottom (#16)"

In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared. It had seemed they’d always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again, but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in another.\nHere’s a table:\n\n\n\nName\nAge\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n23\n\n\nJane\n24\n\n\n\nA list:\n\nfirst\nsecond\nthird\n\nA callout block:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHeader within callout block\n\n\n\nSome text.",
