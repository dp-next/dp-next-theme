    "text": "This theme is a Quarto brand extension that provides a set of defaults and customisations on top of the base Bootstrap theme. It is used across DP-Next websites, so when making changes, be careful to avoid breaking things downstream.\nBefore adding custom CSS or JavaScript, check whether your change can be achieved through the theme files or existing Quarto or Bootstrap options—custom code can introduce accessibility issues and is harder to maintain."

The two most important files are _brand.yml and _extension.yml.\n\n_brand.yml\nControls the visual identity of the theme: fonts, colours, and custom CSS rules. Edit this file to change the theme’s appearance. We use fonts from Bunny, a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Fonts. See Quarto’s Brand Elements page for available options.\n\n\n_extension.yml\nDefines the theme metadata and site-wide defaults. The contributes section is where you can set defaults for all sites using the theme like the navbar logo, favicon, or footer text.\n\n\nAdding logos\nLogos live in _extensions/dp-next-theme/logos/. Add new logos there, then reference them in _extension.yml (for navbar or favicon) or directly in .qmd files in repositories using the theme."

For an introduction to the pull request and commit conventions we follow, see these chapters in the Seedcase guidebook:\n\nPull requests\nCommits\n\n\nDevelopment setup\nTo test changes locally, clone the dp-next-theme repository and install the following tools:\n\nuv\njust\nQuarto\n\nThe easiest way to install uv and just is with pipx:\npipx install uv rust-just\nThen set up the pre-commit hooks with:\njust install-precommit\nRun just to see all available commands. The most common one is just run-all, which runs all checks and tests including building the site locally to check for errors.\n\n\nCommits and pull requests\nWhen committing changes, try to follow the Conventional Commits standard for your Git messages. This lets us auto-generate releases using Commitizen. If your commits don’t follow this convention, we’ll revise the pull request title before merging—we use squash merges, so all commits in a pull request are squashed into one."

    "text": "Since we follow Conventional Commits, we’re able to automatically create formal “releases” of the website based on our commit messages. Releases in the context of websites are simply snapshots in time of the website content. We use Commitizen to automatically create these releases using SemVer as the version numbering scheme.\nBecause releases are created based on commit messages, a new release is created quite often—sometimes several times in a day. This also means that any individual release will not have many changes within it.
