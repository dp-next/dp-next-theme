See Quarto’s Brand Elements page for available options.\n\n\n_extension.yml\nDefines the theme metadata and site-wide defaults. The contributes section is where you can set defaults for all sites using the theme like the navbar logo, favicon, or footer text.\n\n\nAdding logos\nLogos live in _extensions/dp-next-theme/logos/. Add new logos there, then reference them in _extension.yml (for navbar or favicon) or directly in .qmd files in repositories using the theme."
